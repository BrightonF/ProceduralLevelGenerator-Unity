title: Generator setup

import { Image, Gallery, GalleryImage } from "@theme/Gallery";

With our level graph prepared, we are now ready to generate our very first dungeon. In order to do that, we have to setup our procedural dungeon generator. There are two ways to do that - you either use the prefab that comes with the plugin or you create your own instance of the generator.

> **Note:** The goal of this guide is not to describe individual options of the generator but rather to describe how to get an instance of the generator with reasonable default configuration. If you are interested in individual options, head to the [Dungeon generator](../generators/dungeon-generator.md) page.
